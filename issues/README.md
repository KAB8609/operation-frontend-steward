# Issues

Issues were logged from a brainstorm of the contributor's nagging code-level frontend annoyances in Magento 1.x, and exploration of the current Magento 2 frontend.

Rather than flood the Magento 2 repo with issues, we setup a spreadsheet to track everything. We may migrate these into GitHub Issues at some point.

### Brainstorm process

1. Brainstorm to generate as many ideas as possible (no critiquing).
1. Discuss each issue and mark duplicates.
1. Expand rationale with comments and use case (if necessary).
1. Assign value/priority, ease of implementation, and acceptance chance.
