# Issues

### See: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgkHIW0ExJHqdGFydXNoQnNFR010MUx3V3V1S1dIbmc

Issues were logged from a brainstorm of the contributor's nagging code-level frontend annoyances in Magento 1.x, and exploration of the current Magento 2 frontend.

Rather than flood the Magento 2 repo with issues, we setup a spreadsheet to track everything. We may migrate these into GitHub Issues at some point.

### Brainstorm process

1. Brainstorm to generate as many ideas as possible (no critiquing).
1. Discuss each issue and mark duplicates.
1. Expand rationale with comments and use case (if necessary).
1. Assign value/priority, ease of implementation, and acceptance chance.

### Pull Requests

Part of the OFS team started making pull requests directly on the Magento 2 repo based on these issues. These are quick wins for improving Magento at the code-level.

If you have any further suggestions, you can add them to this repo's issue tracker or contribute directly to the Magento 2 repo.
