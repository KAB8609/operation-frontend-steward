# Operation Frontend Steward

*Update [2014-02-16] â€” Many (but not all) of the artifacts produced for Operation Frontend Steward have been migrated into this repo.*

*We are working directly with Magento 2's product teams to ensure these concerns are addressed within the product. We are preparing a survey for partners and independent developers to provide feedback to Magento on each issue. Please read through the articles and we'll let you know when the survey is ready.*

Operation Frontend Steward is a four-pronged offense to improve Magento 2's frontend:

1. Define strategic overarching principles Magento 2's frontend needs to uphold (think "10 commandments").
1. Create public documentation of frontend patterns used in Magento 2.
1. Refactor outdated, ignored, and abused frontend code with standardized, lean, extensible, and future-friendly code.
1. Propose frontend architectural changes outside the Hackaton's scope to modernize Magento 2.
